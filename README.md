# üêâ bookwyrm 

This is an ingestion pipeline for Github repos, website, documents, and more.

It takes a list of URLs and outputs a bookwyrm: a long string of docs and embeddings, easily indexed. 

If you've ever wanted to:

- Chat with PDF
- Chat with repo
- Chat with video
- Chat with notebook
- Chat with website
- Chat with files

Well, this doesn't let you do that. It just processes them and spits out chunks of text with embeddings.

When you want to actually chat with it, that's what [concat](https://github.com/deepfates/concat) is for.

## Using with Cog
Use Cog to run predictions:
```sh
cog predict -i urls='["https://github.com/replicate/cog"]'
```

## Using with Python

### Setting Up the Environment
1. **Create a new virtual environment**:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - For `bash` or `zsh`:
     ```sh
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - For `fish`:
     ```sh
     source .venv/bin/activate.fish
     ```


3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Pipeline

1. **Run the main script**:
   ```sh
   python -m bookwyrm.bookwyrm
   ```

This will process the test URLs and save the output to `wyrm.json`.

### Use as a library

```python
import asyncio

from bookwyrm.bookwyrm import process_documents

urls = ["https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/"]
output = asyncio.run(process_documents(urls))
with open("wyrm.json", "w") as f:
    f.write(output.to_json())
```

Run the test script:
```sh
python test_script.py
```

This should process the URLs and save the output to `wyrm.json`, confirming that your environment is correctly set up.

## About
The Bookwyrm model is structured as a Python class that contains three main components:

1. **Documents**: A list of DocumentRecord objects, each representing a document with its index, URI, and metadata.
2. **Chunks**: A list of TextChunk objects, each representing a chunk of text from a document, along with its document index, local index, and global index.
3. **Embeddings**: A NumPy array containing the embeddings for each text chunk.

This structure is designed to efficiently store and manage large collections of documents, their textual content, and their corresponding embeddings. By chunking the documents into smaller text segments and storing their embeddings, the Bookwyrm model enables efficient similarity searches and retrieval of relevant information from the corpus.

The separation of documents, chunks, and embeddings allows for flexible processing and manipulation of the data, while the use of NumPy arrays for embeddings facilitates efficient vector operations and similarity calculations.

The Bookwyrm model can be serialized to and deserialized from JSON format using the `to_json` and `from_json` methods defined in the `Bookwyrm` class.
